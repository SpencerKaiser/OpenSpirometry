      "A test consists of efforts which are individual maneuvers with the spirometer",
      "A test requires between 3-5 efforts before enough data has been collected",
      "During an effort, you should begin exhaling when prompted and you should exhale as hard as you can for as long as you can",
      "An effort should conclude when you have expelled all the air from your lungs. This feeling should be relatively new and it may be slightly uncomfortable."
